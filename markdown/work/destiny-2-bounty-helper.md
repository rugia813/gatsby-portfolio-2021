This is a data analysis tool for the online game Destiny 2, to help streamline daily chores by grouping similar bounties(daily quests) together, so the user knows to do them at the same time, and also highlight keywords to save reading time.

This app is built with Vue.js, connecting Bungie platform api for login authorization, and destiny 2 api for player data. Hosted on Netlify as a static website.
