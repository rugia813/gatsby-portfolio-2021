Tried to make a fast-paced, retro style turn based rpg. 

used Godot game engine, and blender to prerender sprites. 

the idea is to make everything happen fast, like no transition into/out of combat scene and victory screen that kind of things. also cut the time between each character's action, but this turned out to produce too many bugs, had to dial it down. 

learned a lot in making this project, but many times when I encountered a problem, I would said to myself: "should have just do this in 3d", it really makes no sense to do thing this way nowadays, it's just my nostalgia want this old way to work, so I moved on to other things.
