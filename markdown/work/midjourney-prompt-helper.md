Midjourney is a text-to-image AI, basically, you input a text(prompt) to describe a scene, then the AI will render an image according to it.

This app was designed to help coming up with a prompt, by providing you a collection of words or phrases, like different art style or medium, and popular ones that were used most by all users scraped from the midjourney site.

The app was also designed to be convenient to use, the work flow is: 

\- picking words that you might use

\- form the prompt with the words you picked, while deciding the order and punctuation

\- choose modifiers

\- modify final prompt as text, or just click copy

almost all of this steps can be done with just clicks.
